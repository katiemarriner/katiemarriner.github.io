I built a custom interactive using D3.js and JavaScript to reveal patterns in a complex dataset, translating vote similarity scores into interpretable data visualization with a responsive layout. The project required close coordination with reporters to iterate on data structure, visual encoding and user flow.</p>

    <p class="tools">D3.js, Python</p>
    <p class="description">I built a 50-page interactive combining custom-rendered county-level maps and data tables to guide readers and ABC reporters through live election results. I processed and simplified shapefiles into optimized TopoJSON for each state, then dynamically rendered maps with D3 to minimize load.

I used a Web Worker to handle filtering and ranking logic off the main thread, ensuring fast, fluid updates and maintaining performance.</p>
