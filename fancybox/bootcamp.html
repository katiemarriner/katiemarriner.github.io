        <h4>Mental Health Treatment Facilities in North Carolina</h4>
        
        <p class="fancybox-text">This data visualization was created using highcharts, tabletop.js, a GoogleMaps pluggin and Data
        Tables. It was important that I let the data find and tell the story. North Carolina has been in the news recently
        for its lack of mental health facilities, as is the rest of the United States. The state is divided into three regions, the Piedmont holds
        the Research Triange Park and the largest city, Charlotte. Outside of the piedmont region, to the east is the eastern region and
        to the west, the mountain regions, predominantly rural. The American Psychological Association released
        <a href="http://www.apa.org/about/gr/education/rural-need.aspx">a statement</a> about the need for psychologists in rural
        regions of America. The data I presented shows just that, the lack of mental health facilities in the rural regions
        of North Carolina.</p>
